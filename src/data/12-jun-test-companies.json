Under 2023 var företagets totala CO₂e-utsläpp 18,801 tusen ton enligt marknadsbaserad metod och 18,841 tusen ton enligt platsbaserad metod. Scope 1-utsläppen, som innefattar direktkontrollerade aktiviteter som produktion och transport, uppgick till 508,000 ton CO₂e. Scope 2-utsläppen från inköpt energi var 152,000 ton (marknadsbaserad) och 192,000 ton (platsbaserad). Scope 3-utsläppen, som inkluderar indirekta utsläpp från bland annat inköpta varor och tjänster, transporter och avfall, stod för 18,141,000 ton CO₂e. Arla har satt vetenskapligt baserade mål med en minskning av scope 1 och 2-utsläpp med 33% jämfört med 2015. Företaget har också långsiktiga klimatmål att nå netto nollutsläpp senast 2050. Deras rapportering visar även framsteg inom Scope 3-utsläppen med en minskning av CO₂e per kilo mjölk och vassle från 1,29 kilo 2015 till 1,14 kilo 2023. Arla har vidtagit flera åtgärder, inklusive energioptimeringar och investeringar i förnybar energi, vilket bidragit till att minska deras totala klimatpåverkan.",

The largest emissions originated from Scope 3, totalling 2,705,502 tons CO2e, with major contributions from food sales and leased transportation. The company aims for net zero emissions from its own operations by 2030. They have taken several measures to reduce emissions, including the use of renewable fuels and electricity, and energy efficiency improvements in their stores and warehouses. Despite these efforts, emissions increased slightly in 2023 due to higher leased transport in line with business growth. Note that some Scope 3 categories lack data for certain years.",

För Scope 1 noterade bolaget utsläpp på 5865 ton CO2e för 2023, en minskning jämfört med 6513 ton 2022 och 7706 ton 2021, vilket indikerar framsteg inom intern bränsleanvändning och produktion. Scope 2 utsläpp (market based) uppgick till 3150 ton CO2e, en minskning från 4217 ton 2022 och betydligt lägre än 17765 ton 2021, vilket tyder på effektivare elförbrukning och ökad användning av grön energi. Scope 3 utsläpp var omfattande, uppgående till 833976 ton CO2e, en markant ökning från 202528 ton 2022. Företaget har inkluderat nya kategorier under 2023, såsom inköpta varor och tjänster – levererade fordon (276352 ton CO2e), anställdas pendling (5788 ton CO2e), och användningen av sålda produkter – levererade fordon (355650 ton CO2e).

Förbättrade rapporteringsprocesser, som införandet av ett nytt digitalt system, hjälper till att öka noggrannheten och enhetligheten i hållbarhetsrapporteringen.
