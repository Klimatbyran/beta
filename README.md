# Klimatkollen Beta

This is the new version of [klimatkollen.se](https://klimatkollen.se). You'll find our legacy code [here](https://github.com/Klimatbyran/klimatkollen).
This is where we rebuild our site to be faster, better and stronger using TypeScript, Svelte, Astro and Tailwind. Also, this is the place where our new UX/UI is implemented.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

We're using [shadcn](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/) for our components. [Learn how to add new components](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation/astro#thats-it) you then can customize.
