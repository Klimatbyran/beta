# Klimatkollen Beta

This is the new version of [klimatkollen.se](https://klimatkollen.se). You can find our legacy code [here](https://github.com/Klimatbyran/klimatkollen).

We are rebuilding our site to be faster, better, and stronger using TypeScript, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This is also where our new UX/UI is implemented

## 🚀 Project Structure

- **`src/pages/`**: Contains `.tsx` files for each page, exposed as routes based on their file names.
- **`src/components/`**: Contains React components used throughout the site.
- **`public/`**: Contains static assets like images.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                         |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`   |
| `npm run build`   | Builds your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Previews your build locally, before deploying |
