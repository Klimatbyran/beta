# Klimatkollen Beta

This is the new version of [klimatkollen.se](https://klimatkollen.se). You can find our legacy code [here](https://github.com/Klimatbyran/klimatkollen).

We are rebuilding our site to be faster, better, and stronger using TypeScript, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This is also where our new UX/UI is implemented.

## 🚀 Project Structure

- **`src/pages/`**: Contains `.tsx` files for each page, exposed as routes based on their file names.
- **`src/components/`**: Contains React components used throughout the site.
- **`public/`**: Contains static assets like images.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Builds your production site to `./dist/`         |
| `npm run preview`         | Previews your build locally, before deploying    |

We're using [shadcn](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/) for our components. [Learn how to add new components](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation/astro#thats-it) which you can then customize.
