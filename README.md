# Klimatkollen Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of [klimatkollen.se](https://klimatkollen.se), developed using TypeScript, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

Klimatkollen is an open-source, citizen-driven platform designed to visualize climate data. Currently, we are showcasing data from major Swedish companies and Swedish municipalities.

## 🚀 Project Structure

- **`src/pages/`**: Contains `.tsx` files for each page, which are routed based on their filenames.
- **`src/components/`**: Houses reusable React components utilized throughout the application.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets such as images.

## 🧞 Building and Running Locally

To run the project locally, execute the following commands from the root of the project in your terminal:

| Command           | Action                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                         |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:5173`   |
| `npm run build`   | Builds your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Previews your build locally, before deploying |

To see data in your local development server, you must run our API locally or connect to our production API. More information on how to do that can be found [here](https://github.com/Klimatbyran/garbo) in our data pipeline repository.
